# WOW64KernelGates-
WOW64 to 32 bit application kernel caller.

As you probably know, Windows has a subsystem called WOW64 which acts as an emulation layer for 32bit apps under 64bit architectures. Among other things WOW64 is composed by a full set of 32bit stub/proxy libraries who make the app run without problems while WOW manages the switch between 32bit and 64bit OS code.
